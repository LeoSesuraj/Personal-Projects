Welcome to my personal projects repository!

Project 1: Smartphone Price Prediction
• Developed a program that reads phone utility data from a CSV file to predict the price of that cellular 
 device
• Utilized Pandas, Sklearn, and Seaborn software
• Prediction accuracy of 98.38% derived from calculated R square score

Project 2: Train Price Predictor
• Similar to the Phone Price Predictor program, I've utilized the Pandas, Matplotlib,
  Seaborn, and Sklearn software to clean and handle train price data, which I pass to a Random
  Forest Regressor to test and train the model with the provided data. The model I've created
  has an 88.6 percent accuracy rating, which can be improved with further training.

Project 3: Sensor Integrated Biker Safety
• Designed a system integrating ultrasonic sensors to sense bikers within a specific proximity, intended to 
 trigger traffic light changes for biker crossing.
• Utilized breadboard and TI-kits to prototype the model and resemble the complete product
• Engineered real-time data display based on Python scripts
